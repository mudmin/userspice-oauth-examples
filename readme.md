Each folder contains a complete example of how to connect to a UserSpice OAuth server, authenticate and come all the way back to the point of login in or creating an account. They're designed as standalone examples that will fully run without any outside code.

The wordpress plugin is a complete plugin that can be installed into a current wordpress install and used to authenticate.  

Each folder has a readme and any relevant code examples.  UserSpice's spice shaker has both the OAuth Server plugin as well as a pre-made UserSpice Client plugin.
